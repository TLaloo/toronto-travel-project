            <h3>Toronto is Canada's largest city</h3>
            <p>
              Toronto is Canada’s largest city and a world leader in such areas
              as business, finance, technology, entertainment and culture. Its
              large population of immigrants from all over the globe has also
              made Toronto one of the most multicultural cities in the world.
              This is evident in the various cuisines that are available
              throughout the city.
            </p>
            <p>
              Toronto is one of the world’s most culturally diverse cities, just
              take a look at the city’s culinary scene. In restaurants, cafés,
              markets, and grocery stores across the city, you’ll find delicious
              dishes from every corner of the globe. Collectively, these
              establishments have produced a food scene you will want to
              explore.
